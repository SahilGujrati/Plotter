**Project name**<br />
Plotter

**Project description**<br />
This is my first ever React.js project. It is inspired by matplotlib, a python plotting library. However, plotter is currently limited to creating scatter plots only.

**Project Flow**<br />
I first created the UI design for plotter in Adobe XD, finalizing typography, color palette, and spacing and sizing between elements. Further, I scaffolded the project using Vite, created React components, built the needed logic, and committed and pushed all the files to this repository.

**What I learnt**
1. Fundamentals of UI design, including typography, color, and white space utilisation.
2. Creating React.js functional components, and styling them effectively using css, referring to .xd design file for the project.
3. Using the the react "useState" hook to grab values from input fields.
4. Rendering graphic elements to HTML5 canvas using the canvas API, and the data I received from the user.
5. Learnt the basics of using git, how to add files for tracking, committing changes, and pushing them to the online github repository.

**What I could have done better**
1. Writing better descriptions while committing files.
2. Creating a responsive design for the web app and implementing it.

**How I intend to take the project further**
1. I would like Plotter to be able to plot line graphs, pie graphs, bar graphs and histograms as well.
2. I intend to have a responsive web design for the web app.
